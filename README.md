# Statistics Support - Part 1 (09/16/2025)

## Approaches to Data Analysis - Melinda Higgins, PhD

[Dr. Melinda Higgins](https://melindahiggins.netlify.app/) will not be in person today as she is attending the [Posit (formerly RStudio) Conference](https://posit.co/conference/) in Atlanta, GA.

However, please review these presentations and her accompanying video lecture. _Right Click and Save As or Download the files linked below to view the PPT (PowerPoint) slides_

### Slides and Video

* [Data Analysis Approaches by Wenhui (Vivian) Zhang, PhD](data_analysis_approaches_N_710_2025.pptx)
* [Levels of Measurement by Melinda Higgins, PhD](Levels_of_Measurement_clarified_MHiggins_May2020.pptx)
* [Correlation Foundation by Melinda Higgins, PhD](MHiggins_CorrelationFoundation_08302020_fix.pptx)
* [Melinda's Video Lecture on Echo360]() - TO BE POSTED LATER

### Supplemental Materials - Sample Size, Power and Effect Sizes

* [Power, Sample Size Lecture and Materials - by Melinda Higgins](https://melindahiggins2000.github.io/MHiggins_PowerLecture_GPowerExercises/)
    - see the PPT slides - slides 29, 33, 35, 41, and 49 give the sample sizes needed to achieve 80% power at 5% level of significance for the most common statistical tests, correlation and linear and logistic regression models.
    - for example, you need a sample size of ~ 80-120 (approximately) to detect a moderate effect size (doesn't matter which test or model) in general
* Converting Effect Sizes and Interpretation
    - [https://www.psychometrica.de/effect_size.html](https://www.psychometrica.de/effect_size.html) - go to item 14 to convert between different effect sizes
    - [https://www.psychometrica.de/effect_size.html](https://www.psychometrica.de/effect_size.html) - also see item 16 for “Table of interpretation for different effect sizes””

## Stats Lab: Tables and Figures - Jordan Pelkmans

In class today, [Jordan Pelkmans ONR Biostatistician](https://www.nursing.emory.edu/pages/onrstatsdata#Content-Section-5) and [Jordan's Profile Link](https://www.nursing.emory.edu/faculty-staff/jordan-pelkmans) will work with you to begin laying out the descriptive statisics and perhaps other group comparisons to describe your dataset for your NRSG 710 project. You will begin building "Table 1" for your projects.
